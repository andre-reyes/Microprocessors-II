# Lab 1 - Snake Game Controller
    The purpose of this lab is to implement a serial communication between the ATMEGA 2560 and snake.py game using pyserial. 
This is accomplished using a joystick module and the MPU-6050 gyroscope. As well as sounding a buzzer on the arduino 
whenever an apple is eaten in the snake.py game.
