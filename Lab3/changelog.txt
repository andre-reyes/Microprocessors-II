    -created initial circuit diagram/schematic, includes connections for rtc, motor, lcd
11/9/23
    -wired lcd, redesigned circuit for better wirting on breadboard
    -used elegoo, lcd and rtc examples
    -displayed time on lcd
    -rtc library doesn't 0 pad and when time (seconds) is 1 digit, "9" still displays after "59"
    - used https://www.baldengineer.com/arduino-lcd-display-tips.html as insperation to use sprintf
    -sprintf allowed for 0 padding
    -created buffer of output to draw display all at once instead of 1 char at a time
        -this prevented ghosting and allowed for customization of padding and lcd config
    -basic strings hardcoded for speed and direction to test display
    displayed as:
            /////////////////////////////////////////
            //DIR: {C, CC} SPD: {full, 3/4, 1/2, 0}//
            //            00:00:00                 //            
            /////////////////////////////////////////
    -rerouted L293D EN pin from always HIGH to Digital pin to control power to motor
